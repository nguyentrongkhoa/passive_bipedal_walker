# **What's new?**
- The foot is modelled as a continuous surface as opposed to design 4.
- The foot surface angled is reduced from 17 down to 12 degrees.
# **Problems**
- The narrowness of the hip leads to inter-foot collision in real life as a result of play between the components.
- Also, the hip's width might be responsible for instability issues.
- The hip link exhibits unrealistically high angular velocities. It is supposed that the lack of joint damping might have caused this issue. Additionally, switching from Bullet to DART can be advantageous in this regard.
