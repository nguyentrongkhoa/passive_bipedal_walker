# **Description**
The videos contained in this directory are divided into the following categories:
1. Comparison of different physics engines (ODE, Bullet and Dart).
2. Comparison of different physics engines when the walker is dropped from high above the ramp. ODE especially  displays erratic behaviour and is thus eliminated as the engine of choice.
3. Exhaustive simulations of various configurations of joint angles using Bullet as the preferred physics engine.
